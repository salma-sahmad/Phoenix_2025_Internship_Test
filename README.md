Linux kernel module using kprobes that can monitor and control system call behavior with three operational modes. The module implements an “off” mode , a “log” mode – for recording open, read, and write syscalls with their arguments –, and a “block” mode to prevent sepcific syscalls for targeted processes.The implementation  also requires creating  an ioctl interface to allow communication between user space and kernel space in addition to runtime configuration changes.
